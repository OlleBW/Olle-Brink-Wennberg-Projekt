      Hello! This is going to be a short and easy guide to the Fate universe. I
      am going to try my best at explaining and guiding you to the easiest entry
      point into this beheamot of a franchise. If you've ever heard of the Fate
      franchise, you know just how in depth and confusing it is. I know of many
      who have avoided the show because of it's complexity. I will not be going
      into all of Fate, but instead only cover the most important timelines. On
      this front page I will be giving the short answer as to how to watch the
      series but as you will find out if you keep reading, the short answer is
      too short.
    <h3 class="TA">The Short Answer</h3>
      The first series you wanna watch is Fate Stay/Night and that is where you
      should start, but as you will soon find out that is in itself complicated.
      After you have gotten through Stay/Night you can pretty much watch
      anything in any order and it doesn't matter. That was the short answer. To
      continue the guide, make your way
