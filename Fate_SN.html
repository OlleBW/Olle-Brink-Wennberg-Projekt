      Fate stay night is the introduction and the first released series in Fate.
      It originally satrted as a visual novel developed and published by
      Type-Moon. And since it is the first ever published media with the "Fate"
      name, then the entry point into the series should be easy. The only
      problem is that the visual novel is 100+ hours long and require you to
      play it multiple time in order to fully experience it. So if you have that
      much on your hands, you have your answer.
      <br /><br />
      Now if you want to take the route of the anime only or if you don't have
      the 100+ hours to spend, then your answer is a bit more complicated. The
      problem with the anime comes from the source material, and that problem is
      the multiple endings. You can't really have a tv show with multiple
      endings, that just doesn't work. So the solution was to adapt all the
      routes into different series. And this is where it starts getting
      complicated.
      <br /><br />
      They adapted it into 3 series: Fate Stay/Night Unlimited Bladeworks which
      has 2 seasons and a one off episode called Sunny Day which is one of the
      routes of the visual novel. But Fate Stay/Night Unlimited Bladeworks Sunny
      Day does not adapt the same route as Fate Stay/Night Unlimited Bladeworks,
      they just happened to share the same name when they were was adapted. And
      Fate Stay/Night Unlimited Bladeworks and its sequel season is what you
      want to start off with as it is the only of the three adaptations that
      includes world building.
      <br /><br />
      Now that answers what show to start with, but what to watch after
      Unlimited Bladeworks is what is confusing to alot of people. You have Fate
      Stay/Night Heavens Feel which is a series of three movies that covers the
      last of the three routes of Fate Stay/Night, and you have Fate/Zero. If
      you decide to watch Heavens Feel first, you will be spoiled on some plot
      points of Fate/Zero, but if you watch Fate/Zero first you will be spoiled
      of some plot points of Heavens Feel. This makes it really difficult to
      pick what to watch first, as it is kind of a double edged sword. Depending
      on who you ask you will get a different answer, but in my opinion you
      should start with Heavens Feel as it spoils less about Fate/Zero than vice
      versa.
      <br /><br />
      To summarize, watch Fate Stay/Night Unlimited Bladeworks season 1 and 2,
      then you watch Fate Stay/Night Heavens feel movie 1, 2 and 3, then you
      watch Fate/Zero. And congratulations you have now gotten through the
      introduction and about 10% of Fate. After this point you can pretty much
      watch and read whatever you want in whatever order as none of the other
      shows have anything to do with Stay/Night. My reccomendation after this is
      to consume Fate Grand Order which is one hell of a timeline, or rather
      timelines.
